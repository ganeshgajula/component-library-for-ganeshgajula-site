          <p>
            In JavaScript, variable declarations are done using keywords such as
            <strong>var</strong>, <strong>let</strong> & <strong>const</strong>.
            var has been around since the beginning of the javascript, while let
            and const were introduced in ES2015 also called ES6 which was an
            update to the javascript language that included many new features.
            let & const have a big advantage when it comes to block level scope.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a variable is declared in JavaScript it can have either
            function level scope or block level scope based on the keyword used
            during declaration. Variables declared using var keyword have a
            <strong>function level scope</strong>, while variables declared
            using let & const have a <strong>block level scope</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's first look at the variable declarations then we'll deeply
            understand what the function level & block level scope means.
          </p>

          <h2>Variable Declaration</h2>
          <h3>var</h3>
          <p>
            Variable declaration using var keyword is done similar to how we
            declare variables in other programming languages. Also, once
            declared the variables can be reassigned to some other value if
            required.
          </p>
          <h4 class="code">See the code snippet below:</h4>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog1-snippet1.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h3>let</h3>
          <p>
            let works very similar to var, infact it is identical on the global
            scope, but let have certain advantages when it comes to block level
            scoping which we'll be seeing in the later sections. We can reassign
            a variable in let similar to what we have done in var above.
          </p>
          <h4 class="code">See the code snippet below:</h4>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog1-snippet2.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h3>const</h3>
          <p>
            Variables declared using const keyword are immutable. const works
            differently as compared to var & let. const stands for constant
            hence it cannot be changed, once a value is assigned during
            declaration it cannot be reassigned.
          </p>
          <h4 class="code">See the code snippet below:</h4>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog1-snippet3.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            But when it comes arrays & objects const works little differently.
          </p>
          <h4 class="code">Look at the below code snippet.</h4>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog1-snippet4.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Now you might be thinking that as person is constant object then how
            come we are able to change its properties. This is possible because
            const keyword creates immutable bindings i.e. we cannot reassign the
            variable identifier but we can change the properties of an object
            i.e. the stuff which is inside an object, but we cannot reassign
            person completely to an entire new object. Same goes with arrays.
          </p>
          <h4 class="code">See the code snippet below.</h4>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog1-snippet5.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            So in the above snippet we are creating a variable numbers using
            const keyword and assigning it to an array. But, later we are
            inserting a new value into an array & we can do that as we are just
            inserting a value to an already assigned array. But we cannot
            reassign a completely new array, if done it will throw an error
            which you can see in the snippet above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we have explored all the variable declaration keywords. So it
            completely depends on developer which keyword to use. But the modern
            javascript i.e. In ES6, it is generally advised to use let instead
            of var as there are lot of disadvantages based on its scope level
            which we'll look now.
          </p>
          <h2>There are basically two types of scope level in JavaScript:</h2>
          <ol class="blog-ordered-list">
            <li><strong>Function level scope. </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Block level scope. </strong></li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Function Scope</h2>
          <p>
            Variables declared using var keyword in JavaScript are functioned
            scoped i.e. their scope is limited within a function in which it has
            been declared. Hence, they cannot be accessed outside the function.
          </p>
          <h4 class="code">See the code snippet below.</h4>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog1-snippet6.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            So, we can see above that variables declared using keyword var
            inside the function test() are accessible only within that function,
            if used outside the function then its globally assigned values are
            being accessed.
          </p>
          <h2>Block Scope</h2>
          <p>
            Variables declared using let & const keywords in JavaScript are
            block scoped i.e. their scope is limited within a block in which it
            has been declared. Hence, they cannot be accessed outside the block.
            Here, block means an if statement, a loop or anything that's wrapped
            in a curly braces {}.
          </p>
          <h4 class="code">See the code snippet below:</h4>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog1-snippet7.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Now notice when we are logging global scope at the very bottom of
            the code we are getting output as 4 2 3, but initially in the global
            scope (at the very top) we have defined a = 1 but in the block scope
            that a variable is redeclared to 4 due to which we are getting value
            of a as 4 in the global scope.
          </p>
          <p>
            But variables b & c which are declared using keywords let & const
            are still 2 & 3 (see at the very bottom of the code) even though
            inside the block scope we have set them to 5 & 6. This is because
            that's what we initially set them to.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the way let & const works is how most programming languages work,
            but var is kind of weird due to which let & const were introduced in
            ES6.
          </p>
          <h2>So to sum up</h2>
          <ol class="blog-ordered-list">
            <li>
              Variables declared using var keyword can be redeclared &
              reassigned at a later stage and its scope is limited within a
              function.
            </li>
            <li>
              Variables declared using let keyword can be reassigned at a later
              stage and its scope is limited within a block.
            </li>
            <li>
              Variables declared using const keyword cannot be reassigned at a
              later stage and its scope is limited within a block.
            </li>
          </ol>
