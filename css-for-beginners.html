          <p>
            CSS defines the way things look on a website and to further add
            interactivity to a website we use JavaScript. When we start building
            any website we usually start by writing HTML first, which is the
            actual content that is being displayed on the website. But, we also
            need to style our website so that it catches the attention of the
            person visiting the website. This is where CSS comes into action.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> and is a very
            powerful tool for designing our website. It can instantly beautify a
            website to a whole new level. So in this post I'll walk you all
            through the basics of CSS to introducing all the things you need to
            know to style your website.
          </p>
          <p>So first lets look at the syntax.</p>
          <h2>SYNTAX</h2>
          <p>
            CSS consists of a <strong>selector</strong> and a
            <strong>declaration block</strong>. The selector points to the HTML
            element which we want to style whereas the declaration block
            contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. The
            declaration consists of a CSS property name and a value separated by
            a colon. See the image below
          </p>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog2-snippet1.png" alt="" />
          </div>

          <p>
            In the above image we can see that p tag is a selector and
            everything that's inside the curly braces is declaration which
            consists of color as a property and red as a value. On using the
            above styling into our CSS file will convert all the content
            enclosed within the p tag into red color.
          </p>
          <h2>SELECTORS</h2>

          <p>
            Selectors in CSS specify which HTML elements we want to style. For
            example, when we write h1 as a selector and then assign a
            declaration to it which consists of a property and value. Then all
            the h1's which are present in our html file are being modified based
            on property and value.
          </p>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog2-snippet2.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            We can also use multiple selectors separated by a comma and then
            assigning a declaration which will make an effect on all of them at
            once. See the code snippet below.
          </p>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog2-snippet3.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h2>PROPERTIES</h2>
          <p>
            So now lets explore the properties in CSS which are most important
            to style our website. Based on the properties used, the styles are
            being applied to that particular selector. Some of the most used
            properties are:
          </p>
          <h3>COLOR</h3>
          <p>
            In CSS, by using the color property and assigning it to a predefined
            color we can change the color of the content enclosed in that
            particular selector.
          </p>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog2-snippet4.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <ol class="blog-ordered-list">
            <li><strong>By Specifying the RGB value of the color. </strong></li>
            <li><strong>By Specifying the HEX value of the color. </strong></li>
          </ol>
          <h4>1. RGB Value</h4>
          <p>
            An RGB value is a combination of 3 values i.e red, green & blue.
            Here, each parameter defines the intensity of the color between 0
            and 255.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we set all the parameters to 0 i.e. by setting rgb(0,0,0) we get
            black color. While if we set all the parameters to 255 i.e. by
            setting rgb(255,255,255) we get white color. Also, setting any one
            parameter to 255 and rest all to 0 will give us the color of the
            parameter that is being set to 255. For example. rgb(255,0,0) will
            give us red.
          </p>
          <p>

            >
          </p>

          <h4>2. HEX Value</h4>

          <p>
            Similar to rgb, an HEX value is also a combination of 3 values i.e.
            red, green & blue but in hexadecimal format which is #rrggbb. Here,
            rr refers to red, gg refers to green & bb refers to blue with their
            values ranging between 00 and ff, ff being the highest and 00 being
            the lowest. For example. hex(#ff0000) will give a red color.
          </p>
          <h3>TEXT</h3>
          <p>
            Using CSS we can also style our text, we can change the font size,
            font style, add spacing between the words & letters and many more
            stuff. We can use different font styles based on our requirement,
            some of the best font styles can be found at
            <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            For font sizes we can use pixels(px), rem , em units. rem is
            relative to font-size of the root element, em is relative to the
            font-size of the element. If size of the root element is not set
            then by default it is 16px. To read more

          </p>
          <h2>CSS BOX MODEL</h2>
          <p>
            The CSS box model is like a box which is wrapped around each & every
            HTML element. It mainly consists of margins, borders, padding &
            actual content.
          </p>
          <h4 class="code">See the diagram below:</h4>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog2-snippet5.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            In the above image, we can see that to add the spacing around the
            actual content we need to use padding, and to add a spacing around
            the padding and the content we need to use border spacing, and
            finally to add the spacing outside the element i.e. to add spacing
            between two elements we use margin. Also, we can use margin: auto to
            center the elements.
          </p>
          <h2>DISPLAY</h2>
          <p>
            The CSS display property is widely used to control the layouts. It
            specifies how an element must be displayed. Elements usually have
            their default display values set to either inline or block.
          </p>
          <h3>Inline Elements</h3>

          <p>
            We can set the display property to inline by declaring display:
            inline. Inline removes the line breaks after an element due to which
            each element occupies the space equivalent to the content or text
            present inside it. Some of the default inline elements are span, a,
            img
          </p>
          <h4 class="code">See the image below.</h4>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog2-snippet6.png" alt="" />
          </div>

            >
          </p>

          <h3>Block Elements</h3>
          <p>
            We can set the display property to block by declaring display:
            block. Elements whose display property is set as block always start
            on a new line and take the full width available. Two elements won't
            be placed next to each other. Some of the default block elements
            are: div, h1 ... h6, p etc.
          </p>
          <h4 class="code">See the image below:</h4>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog2-snippet7.png" alt="" />
          </div>

          </p>
          <h2>CLASSES & ID's</h2>

          <p>
            To select a group of elements we use classes and ids in our html.
            Classes are used when we want to reuse the same class name in other
            elements as well, while id's are used when we want to assign an id
            to an element which won't be reused again for other elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Classes are included in css file using dot and then followed by
            assigned classname (.className) while ids are included using # and
            then followed by assigned idName (#idname).
          </p>
          <p>
            Below we have put class as center into two p tags. So, now by using
            the class name we can style the way we want.
          </p>
          <h4 class="code">See the code snippet below:</h4>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog2-snippet8.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            So now by using class we can style those two p tags as per our need.
            Let's align them to center.
          </p>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog2-snippet9.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h4 class="code">Output will be</h4>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog2-snippet10.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            So as you can see using class we have centered group of elements
            together.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>Similarly we can do this using ids using #</p>
          <div class="blog-content-img">
            <img src="/images/blog2-snippet11.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            To see code for ids

          <p>
            Hope, I was able to cover most of the topics of CSS to get a
            beginner started, but there's still a lot of topics in CSS to learn
            if you want to become a pro at it.
